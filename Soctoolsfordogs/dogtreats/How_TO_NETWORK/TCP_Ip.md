### What is TCP/IP and what does it stand for?
[TCP/IPlink2](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/TCP-IP)

TCP/IP is a data link protocol used on the internet to let computers and other devices send and receive data. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and makes it possible for devices connected to the internet to communicate with one another across networks.

### What does TCP/IP do?

TCP/IP determines **how computers transfer data** from one device to another. This data needs to be kept accurate so that the receiver gets the same information that the sender originally sent.

So what is TCP/IP and how does it work? To ensure that each communication reaches its intended destination intact, the TCP/IP model breaks down data into _packets_ and then reassembles the packets into the complete message on the other end. Sending the data in small packets makes it easier to maintain accuracy versus sending all the data at once.

After a single message is split into packets, these packets may travel along different routes if one route is congested. It’s like sending a few different birthday cards to the same household by mail. The cards begin their journey at your home, but you might drop each card into a different mailbox, and each card may take a different path to the recipient’s address.

### How does the TCP/IP model work?

Whenever you send something over the internet — a message, a photo, a file — the TCP/IP model divides that data into packets according to a [four-layer procedure](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-tcp-ip#what-are-the-layers-of-the-tcpip-model). The data first goes through these layers in one order, and then in reverse order as the data is reassembled on the receiving end.

The TCP/IP model works because **the whole process is standardized**. Without standardization, communication would go haywire and slow things down — and fast internet service relies on efficiency. As the global standard, the TCP/IP model is one of the most efficient ways to transfer data over the internet.

### Other common internet protocols

The TCP/IP model covers many internet protocols, which define how data is addressed and sent over the internet. [Common internet protocols](Protocols.md) include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, and all three are often used **in conjunction** with the TCP/IP model.

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** governs the workings of web browsers and websites.
    
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** defines how files are sent over a network.
    
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is used to send and receive email.
    

VPN protocols, such as OpenVPN, create secure and private networks through the internet. AVG Secure VPN uses powerful data encryption to secure your internet connection, while hiding your IP address.
